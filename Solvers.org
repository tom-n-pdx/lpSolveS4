* Solvers
  Looking at the solvers, I must support the academic Gurobi solver.

  For open source, GLOP may make the most sense - otherwise GLPK



** Gurobi


** CLP - https://projects.coin-or.org/Clp


** GLOP - https://developers.google.com/optimization/
   * Includes C++ / python interfaces to GLOP, plus CBC, CLP, GLPK, Gurobi, CPLEX, SCIP, and Sulum.


** GLPK - https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html
   * Open source, C interface only


** lpSolve
   * Oldest solver


* Phase?

  * Simple DEA

  * DEA setting everything up with data to iterate on

  * Implement inner loop in C

  * Make inner lope parallel

  * Use abstracted interface to solver - ROI?
