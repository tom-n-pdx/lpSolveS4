# lpSolveS4
Generic Object-oriented linear solver front-end for lp_solve

Status: Working, not yet submitted to CRAN, limited core functionality

I am using a linear solver for DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) and I wanted to cleanup my code for using the
solver. A OOP interface to the solver looked like a good way to clean up the interface and make the code for
DEA simpler.
